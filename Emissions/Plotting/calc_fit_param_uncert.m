%UNCERT = CALC_FIT_PARAM_UNCERT( FIT_PARAMS, FIT_FRAC_UNCERTS )
% Given the values for the EMG fitting parameters, FIT_PARAMS, and their
% fractional uncertainties, FIT_FRAC_UNCERTS, this will calculate the
% overall uncertainty of the parameters. Note that FIT_FRAC_UNCERTS should
% truly be the fractional uncertainty, that is, if the uncertainty is
% one-half the value of the parameter, it should be represented by 0.5, not
% 50. The return value, UNCERT is an array the same size as FIT_PARAMS and
% FIT_FRAC_UNCERTS that contains the absolute uncertainties for each value.
%
% The calculation of uncertainty follows the supplement in Beirle
% et. al. They assign the following uncertainties:
%
%   VCD = 30%, 25% in Lu et al. 2015 
%   NOx:NO2 ratio = 10% Fit
%   confidence interval = ~10-50%
%   SME (standard mean error?) of fit results = ~10-40%
%   Choice of b (across wind integration distance) = 10%
%   Choice of wind fields = 30%
%
% This will ignore the SME as Lu et al 2015 does, because that was for
% Beirle's average over 8 different sectors, rather than the method of
% aligning wind directions. Lu goes on to specify that NOx:NO2 ratio only
% matters for emissions (E ~ a*w/x0 where w is avg. wind speed) but not
% burdens (a) or lifetime (tau = x0 / w) and the uncertainty in VCDs does
% not matter for lifetime. However, I would argue that the uncertainty in
% VCDs DOES matter for lifetime as a spatial bias in the VCDs could
% introduce essentially a second lifetime that would convolve with the true
% lifetime. So this will assume that all the sources of uncertainty count
% for all the fit parameters, except for the NOx:NO2 ratio which is only
% use for emissions (which are not computed here, but instead in
% compute_emg_emis_tau).
%
%UNCERT = CALC_FIT_PARAM_UNCERT( FIT_PARAMS, FIT_FRAC_UNCERTS, NUM_OBS )
% This will use the number of observations given in the array NUM_OBS to
% reduce the error due to VCDs by sqrt(n). Here, n is conservatively taken
% as the fewest number of observations in any single grid cell given by
% NUM_OBS (usually the output NUM_VALID_OBS from CALC_LINE_DENSITY). If not
% given, the value of 25% uncertainty in VCDs will be used unaltered.
%
%CALC_FIT_PARAM_UNCERT( ___ , 'warn', false ) will disable the warning
%about the use of VCD uncertainty of 25%.
