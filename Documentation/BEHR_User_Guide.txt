2. Recommended filtering criteria
=================================

    When filtering the pixels, I look for 6 criteria:
        1) The VCD must be > 0 (values < 0 are present in the OMNO2 data, but do
not make physical sense)
        2) The vcdQualityFlags field must be an even number. This indicates that
the summary bit is not set, meaning there were no significant processing issues.
        3) Cloud fraction: BEHR contains three cloud fractions: OMI geometric,
OMI radiance, and MODIS cloud fraction.
        4) The column amount should be < 1 x 10^17. Such values are expected to
indicate that the pixel has been affected by the row anomaly.
        5) The column amount must not be a NaN.
        6) Filter for row anomaly, typically by requiring that the
XTrackQualityFlags field = 0.

3. BEHR Fields in native pixels
================================

BEHRAMFTrop: The AMF for each pixel that is calculated using the NASA OMNO2
scattering weights, but with MODIS albedo, GLOBE terrain pressure, and WRF-Chem
12-km resolution NO2 profiles and scaled by BEHRGhostFraction.

BEHRGhostFraction: A factor for each pixel that multiplies the initial AMF
calculated as a cloud radiance fraction weighted average of a clear and cloudy
AMF. 

BEHRScatteringWeights: Each row of scattering weights corresponds to a pixel.
These scattering weights are the weighted average of the clear and cloudy
scattering weights used to calculate the BEHR AMF. There are 28-30 scattering
weights per pixel; 28 are at the standard OMNO2 pressures and the remaining two
are the scattering weights calculated for the terrain and cloud pressure - this
helps ensure that the interpolation we use to obtain those levels is reflected
in these published scattering weights. If the terrain or cloud pressure equals
one of the OMNO2 pressures, there will be fewer than 30 scattering weights for
that pixel, and the vector will be padded with fill values to bring it up to 30
elements.

BEHRAvgKernels: The above scattering weights divided by the AMF for this pixel -
there is no more complicated computation than that, these are present to make
that calculation easier for users. As with the scattering weights, each row
represents a pixel and if less than 30 values are used to describe the vector,
it is padded with fill values to make a 30 element vector.

BEHRNO2apriori: This is the NO2 profile for the pixel used to calculate the AMF
for this pixel. As above, each row in the matrix represents a pixel and fill
values are used if there are less than 30 elements. It is given as a mixing
ratio in parts-per-part. Note that an AMF should be calculated by integrating
over number density; we follow the conversion described in the appendix of
Ziemke, et al. (2001) J. Geophys. Res., 106, p. 9853 to perform this integration
using the hydrostatic relation.

BEHRPressureLevels: These are the pressure levels for the last 3 fields; as in
those, each row corresponds to a pixel. 28 of the 30 pressures will always be
the standard OMNO2 pressure levels, the remaining two (as discussed for the
scattering weights) as the terrain and cloud pressure.
