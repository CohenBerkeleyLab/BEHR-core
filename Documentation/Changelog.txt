1) Preface

(I) Version numbering system

The BEHR version numbering system combines the OMNO2 version number with an
internal version letter. So, v2.1A represents the first BEHR product based on
version 2.1 of the NASA OMNO2 product. A subsequent version of BEHR still based
on version 2.1 of OMNO2 would be v2.1B. When OMNO2 updated to version 3, the BEHR 
product based on that was named v3.0A.

Should a minor change be made (e.g. one that adds information to the output but
does not change the core algorithm), a revision number will be appended to the
version number. For example, v2.1A and v2.1Arev0 will be the same, but v2.1Arev1
would indicate this sort of minor change.

The version number may also be formatted as, e.g. v2-1A. This is used as the version
string in file names to prevent any issue with file systems unable to handle a . in
a filename that is not separating the file extension. This form is completely
equivalent to the one with the period and is used interchangeably.

2) Changelog
============

**** 3.0B ****
-- Bug in the BEHRQualityFlags field fixed; previously the quality summary bit (least
   significant bit) only flagged pixels with low quality albedo data and the error
   summary bit (2nd least significant bit) only flagged pixels affected by the row
   anomaly.
-- Clear and cloudy scattering weights are now published separately; averaging kernels
   are still the cloud radiance fraction-weighted sum of clear and cloudy sensitivities.

**** 3.0A ****
-- We will no longer produce the csv file version of BEHR due to the increasing number
   of products that must be produced (monthly and daily profiles, additional regions).
-- Base tropospheric SCDs updated to NASA OMI SP v3.0
-- Pixel corners now derived from the OMPIXCOR product; the old "Loncorn" and "Latcorn"
   fields have been removed. All non-OMI data products (MODIS, GLOBE, WRF-Chem) are 
   averaged to OMI pixels using the FoV75Corner fields. Tiled fields are included as
   well.
-- MODISAlbedo is now derived from the MCD43D BRDF product rather than the MCD43C3 black
   sky albedo product. Since v006 of MCD43D is available for each day, we use the MCD43D
   file corresponding to each day retrieved, rather than the nearest of the 16-day averages.
   The BRDF kernels are calculated according to the Eq. (38) and (39) of the MOD43 Theoretical
   basis document (https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod09.pdf, accessed 18 Sept 2017).
   Combined with the MCD43D coefficients, these provide the BRDF reflectivities within each
   OMI pixel, which are then averaged to the OMI pixel. (Band 3 data from MCD43D07, MCD43D08, and
   MCD43D09 used, with quality flag information from MCD43D31.)
-- All non-fill MCD43D data is used to calculate the average BRDF coefficients for each pixel; 
   however, if the average quality for the BRDF data is >= 2.5, the OMI pixel in question is flagged
   as low quality. (MCD43D quality is denoted as 0-3, 0 is best quality, 3 is lowest.) Likewise,
   if more than half of the MCD43D data in a pixel are fill values, the OMI pixel is also flagged
   as low quality.
-- OMI pixels are now classified as land or ocean based on the MODIS land-water map available
   from ftp://rsftp.eeos.umb.edu/data02/Gapfilled/. If more than half of the OMI pixel is defined
   as shallow ocean (class 0), moderate or continental ocean (class 6) or deep ocean (class 7) by
   the land-water map, the pixel is classified as ocean and surface reflectance calculated based
   on solar zenith angle and a parameterization derived from the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Radiative
   Transfer (COART) model (https://cloudsgate2.larc.nasa.gov/jin/coart.html). This replaces the
   previous SZA look up table.
-- The formulation of the visible-only AMF has been changed: now the visible only AMF is
   calculated as the ratio of the model slant column to the model visible VCD. Previously,
   a cloudy visible-only AMF was calculated as the ratio of the model above-cloud slant 
   column to the model above-cloud vertical column, which is combined with the clear sky
   AMF (weighted by the cloud radiance fraction) to give the total AMF. This new method has
   an easier physical interpretation and can be better reproduced using the published scattering
   weights and NO2 profiles.
-- New a priori profiles: the NO2 a priori profiles were generated with WRF-Chem at 12 km
   resolution using 2012 emissions and the lightning configuration discussed in Laughner
   and Cohen, AMTD, 2017, doi: 10.5194/amt-2017-263. The previous profiles did not include
   lightning. 
-- A product using daily NO2 profiles will be added as the simulation of those profiles is completed.
   We expect to provide data using daily NO2 profiles for 2007-2009 and 2012-2014, possibly including
   2005 and 2006 as well. NOTE: 2005 and 2006 profiles will be generated using boundary conditions 
   from a different global CTM than 2007+, so caution is advised using 2005 and 2006 in studies of
   NO2 trends.
-- New temperature profiles: the temperature profiles are now taken from the same WRF-Chem simulations
   as the NO2 profiles. This provides higher resolution and (IMPORTANT) fixes a bug in v2.1C in the
   lookup of the NASA standard temperature profiles. That bug resulted in a ~5% bias in the v2.1C 
   columns.
-- New gridding method: BEHR fields are now gridded using the constant value method of the
   omi python package (https://github.com/gkuhl/omi). This corrects an issue where some grid
   cells would not be assigned a value using the previous gridding method.
-- New BEHRQualityFlags field available that summarizes errors in the NASA and BEHR algorithms. Please
   see the user guide for a full description.
-- Additional swath-level attributes added that describe the input data files and the state of the code
   at the time of production. See the user guide for more details.

**** 2.1C ****
-- Change to how ghost columns are handled
-- IMPORTANT: the field BEHRColumnAmountNO2Trop in all prior versions is the total column,
   including the below cloud component (the "ghost column")
-- Previous versions of the user guide stated that multiplying the BEHR VCD by the ghost
   fraction would return the total column; that was incorrect. The BEHR VCD was the total
   column, dividing the VCD by the ghost fraction in previous versions will, in fact, return
   the visible only column.
-- The ghost fraction has been removed in this version, now visible-only fields
   BEHRColumnAmountNO2TropVisOnly and BEHRAMFTropVisOnly give the VCD and AMF for the visible
   only column; that is, the total (to ground) column over the clear part of the pixel plus
   the above-cloud column over the cloudy part of the pixel.

**** 2.1B ****
-- Slight change to VCDs along coasts or over oceans
-- Previous versions used a fill value of -500 m when calculating surface pressure over
   oceans from GLOBE elevation data; hence ocean pixels had a GLOBETerpres value of 
   ~1080 hPa. This has been corrected and ocean pixel will now correctly report a surface
   pressure value of ~1013 hPa.
-- Changes to VCDs in BEHRColumnAmountNO2Trop are generally < 1x10^15 molec. cm^-2, and
   primarily limited to coastlines and regions outside the domain of 25-50 N, 125-65 W.
   These changes occur for two reasons:
    1) Coastline changes occur where the average pixel surface pressure derived from the
       GLOBE elevation data was < 1013 hPa, but greater than it should have been as ocean
       fill values mentioned above were averaged in.  Pure ocean pixels are unaffected 
       because surface pressures are clamped to <= 1013 hPa before AMF computation.
    2) Changes outside 25-50 N, 125-65 W occur where NO2 a priori profiles are available
       but GLOBE data was not imported before. This version imports GLOBE data from 15-60 N
       and 135-55 W, which should cover all pixels with NO2 a priori profiles available.
       Previously, pixels outside the 25-50 N, 125-65 W domain assumed a surface pressure of
       1013 hPa.
-- Any pixels outside the new 15-50 N, 135-55 W GLOBE import region have their GLOBETerpres
   field given a fill value, instead of the previous value of 1013.
-- Pixels without valid MODISAlbedo data would previously have a value of 0 instead of the 
   proper fill value. This has been corrected; it should only affect totally invalid pixels
   (pixels with latitude/longitude unspecified or given as fill values).


**** 2.1Arev1 ****
-- Revision only: no substantial changes to the data product itself.
-- File names will now contain the version number for easier tracability.
-- Corrected issue where fill values for cloud fraction fields are divided by 1000. The
   fields CloudFraction and CloudRadianceFraction will now have fill values of -32767
   instead of -32.767.
-- Terrain reflectivity has now been scaled to actually lie between 0 and 1. 
-- All BEHR fields will now use a fill value of -3.402e38 (-realmax('single') in Matlab).
-- Updated some metadata in the HDF files.
-- The .txt files now replace NaNs with fill values for fields that have fill values defined.
-- In the computation of the BEHR AMF, it has always been clamped to a minimum value of 1e-6.
   This is still true; however, the way Matlab treats NaNs meant that a NaN AMF was changed to
   1e-6, when really we would prefer that it remain a NaN as this usually indicates that either
   the scattering weights or a priori profile were all NaNs as well, due to either the inputs
   to the scattering weight lookup table being outside the ranges defined in that table or 
   the a priori profile being undefined (usually because we are outside the BEHR-US domain).
   Many cases where the AMF should have remained a NaN were returned to NaNs by a later check
   in the code, however now pixels where the AMF is a NaN are never converted to 1e-6 in the 
   first place. *Note: as long as you have been following the recommendation to remove all VCDs
   >1e17 (as an extra guarentee against including row anomaly pixels), you will notice no change,
   as AMFs of 1e-6 lead to VCDs of about 1e20 or greater. 
-- Rarely, cloud pressure may be >1013 hPa. This causes the scattering weight lookup to fail, 
   because the algorithm treats cloud pressure as surface pressure for the cloudy AMF, and the
   lookup table is only defined for surface pressure <= 1013 hPa. Therefore, cloud pressures are
   now clamped to <= 1013 hPa before input to the lookup table.
-- Any pixel with a fill value for ColumnAmountNO2Trop (the standard product tropospheric column)
   now explicitly has BEHRColumnAmountNO2Trop set to NaN in the algorithm (and so a fill value in
   the data here). Because we only grid pixels with a non-NaN value for BEHRColumnAmountNO2Trop,
   this means that the following days have been removed from the gridded product, as they had no
   valid values for ColumnAmountNO2Trop:
    > 2005-07-13
    > 2005-11-02
    > 2006-02-22
    > 2006-07-10
    > 2006-11-03
    > 2007-03-01
    > 2007-07-13
    > 2007-11-06
    > 2008-03-03
    > 2010-01-29


**** 2.1A ****

-- First version produced by Josh Laughner
-- Updated to OMNO2 version 2.1
-- The field ColumnAmountNO2Initial is no longer available
-- GLOBE terrain height now averaged directly to OMI pixels (no pre-averaging to
~4 km resolution)
-- 400 is no longer a fill value for the GLOBETerpres field. There should be no
fill values in this field - grid points in the GLOBE database that do not have a
value are over ocean, and so are assigned a pressure of 1013 hPa.
-- Corrected bug in which the cloud fractions were scaled twice before
inclusion in AMF calculation. (This had only a minor effect on NO2 columns.)
-- Flag fields (vcdQualityFlags, XTrackQualityFlags) will now represent the most
cautious flag in the gridded product (the flags from all pixels averaged
together for a particular grid cell will be combined using a bitwise OR)
-- Dataset numbers in the HDF may have changed due to the removal of
ColumnAmountNO2Initial from OMNO2 (sorry!). Dataset names should be the same.
-- Added scattering weights, averaging kernels, and the pressure levels for
those quantities.  These are calculated as the average of the clear and cloudy
scattering weights weighted by the radiance cloud fraction.  Both include the OMI
temperature correction for the NO2 cross section.
-- Added the a priori NO2 profiles used for each pixel.  This allows advanced users
to compare the effect of a priori choice with a model of their own choosing.
-- Attributes have been added to the HDF files' variables, including unit, 
range, fill value, product (standard (SP) or BEHR), and a description. Each
swath also has an attribute indicating if it is organized by native pixel or
0.05 x 0.05 deg grid.
-- The quantity represented by BEHRColumnAmountNO2Trop will represent only the
visible NO2 column, and will not include any contribution from the ghost column.
The field BEHRGhostFraction will provide a multiplicative factor to add back in
the ghost column (based on WRF-Chem model runs) if desired.
