# Get OMNO2 data, once the machine request has succeeded and the download notice
# has been placed in ~/Documents/dl_notices. That will be handled by a root
# crontab, since the download notice will be put in /home/nasa and owned by user
# nasa.
#
# It may take up to a half an hour for the download notice to be present, so
# this should run about a minute after the root script that requests the
# download notice, and will check once per minute to see if the root script has
# moved the download notice to the download staging folder.
#
# Basically all this will need to do is move the download notice into the
# download_staging folder on the file server and check if the specified file
# does not exist before downloading it. It will also ignore files ending in
# .xml, since these are unnecessary metadata files. The files will be downloaded
# to download_staging, then sorted into proper year/month folders.

# OMNO2DIR must be an environmental variable set pointing to the
# download_staging folder.  I made it and environmental variable so that this
# script can be moved from computer to computer w/o needing to be edited.
