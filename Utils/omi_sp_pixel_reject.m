function [ omi ] = omi_sp_pixel_reject( omi_in, cloud_type, cloud_frac, rowanomaly_mode )
%omi_pixel_reject: Set areaweight to 0 for any pixels that will adversely
%affect the accuracy of OMI SP maps.
%   There are a number of criteria that need to be evaluated for an OMI
%   pixel before it can be reliably used as an NO2 measurement.  This
%   function will set the areaweight value to 0 for any pixel which fails
%   these criteria.  This function is the SP counterpart to
%   "omi_pixel_reject," and has BEHR criteria replaced with regular OMI
%   criteria:
%       - Checking for column amount > 1E17 and column amount = NaN, the
%       field has been changed from "BEHRColumnAmountNO2Trop" to the OMI
%       equivalet "ColumnAmountNO2Trop" 
%        - Cloud fractions will only check against OMI cloud fractions,
%        since obviously MODIS cloud fractions are unavailable.
%
%   Inputs:
%       omi_in: An OMI structure, the result of running BEHR_main.m.
%
%       cloud_type = 'geo' or 'rad' (geometric or radiative), 'omi' is also
%           permitted and will use geometric cloud fractions.
%
%       cloud_frac = maximum allowed gloud fraction (0-1.0)
%
%       rowanomaly_mode: Can be one of 4 values, 'AlwaysByRow',
%          'RowsByTime', 'XTrackFlags', and 'XTrackFlagsLight'.
%          'AlwaysByRow' will always reject pixels in the row affected by
%          the anomaly, regardless of whether the data occurs before or
%          after the anomaly reached that row. 'XTrackFlags' uses the row
%          anomaly flag in the OMNO2 product to reject pixels.  These are
%          the two recommended methods.
%
%   The rejection criteria are:
%       Column amount < 0: Likely a fill value or unphysical result.
%       VCD Quality Flag is not a even number: the VCD quality flag is a
%          bit array, with the least significant bit as a summary.  If this
%          bit is 1, then some error occured during the NASA retrieval and
%          we should ignore this pixel.
%       Cloud fraction too great: Cloudy pixels will have much of the
%          tropospheric column obscured, and should not contribute to the
%          average.
%       Column amount > 1E17: This magnitude of tropospheric column is
%          known to be affected by the row anomaly.
%       Column amount is NaN: NaN indicates some failure, either averaging
%          0 values, or another mathematical mistake.
%       Row anomaly: see http://www.knmi.nl/omi/research/product/rowanomaly-background.php
