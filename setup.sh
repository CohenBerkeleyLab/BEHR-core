If you are running this setup as a grad student on the BEHR project
at Berkeley, you should install GIT and properly clone BEHR from
the the CohenBerkeleyLab GitHub organization.

If you have obtained BEHR by downloading a release from GitHub, you'll
need to also download the following repositories:"

    for repo in ${github_repos[@]}; do
        >&2 echo "    $repo"
    done
}

print_usage() {
    cat <<EOU
Usage: $(basename $0) [--https]|[--ssh]|[--ssh=<alias>]
    Will clone the additional repositories that the BEHR code depends on. Code
    from GitHub can be cloned using either HTTPS or SSH protocols. Cloning with
    HTTPS can be done by anyone, but requires a username and password to push
    changes back. This is the default option. Cloning with SSH requires that you
    have a GitHub account that has access to the BEHR repositories configured 
    with an SSH key.

     Options:
        --https : force this to clone from GitHub using HTTPS protocol. 
        --ssh : force this to clone from GitHub using SSH protocol.
        --ssh=<alias> : clone using SSH protocol, substituting <alias> for 
            "github.com" in the URL. The default URL is "git@github.com:/${fork}/<repo>",
            but if you have an SSH alias setup that specifies which SSH key to use
            to access GitHub, you can specify that here. For example, if I had
            the following in my ~/.ssh/config file:

                Host lab-github
                HostName github.com
                User git
                IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_lab_github
                IdentitiesOnly yes

            then calling

                ./$(basename $0) --ssh=lab-github

            would clone the repositories with "git@lab-github:/${fork}/..."
        --develop : keeps the repos in the develop branch after cloning. Otherwise, 
            check out the master branch for each repo. Generally, most users will
            want the master branch since it is stable. UC Berkeley students working
            on developing the code should use this flag to start in the unstable 
            research branch.

    The repositories will be cloned to:
