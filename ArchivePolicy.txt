When a branch is no longer being actively developed, use the following
git commands to archive it:

git tag -a archive/<branchname> <branchname> -m "Archived: <message>"
git push origin archive/<branchname>

Confirm that the tag exists on both the local and remote repo with:
git tag -l
git ls-remote

You can then delete the branch reference:
git branch -D <branchname>
