classdef BEHR_publishing_gridded_fields
    %BEHR_PUBLISHING_GRIDDED_FIELDS Representation of which data fields should be gridded in the BEHR algorithm
    %   Starting from version 3 of BEHR, we have the capability to grid our
    %   data with either the constant value or parabolic spline method (CVM
    %   and PSM respectively) from Gerrit Kuhlmann's omi Python package. In
    %   keeping with the programming paradigm that all data should have a
    %   single, authoritative representation within a program, this class
    %   indicates which data fields should be gridded using each algorithm.
    %
    %   Properties (all cell arrays of strings):
    %       cvm_gridded_vars: standard data fields that should be gridded
    %       using the CVM method.
    %
    %       psm_gridded_vars: standard data fields that can be gridded
    %       using the PSM method (they may also be gridded with CVM, if
    %       desirable).
    %
    %       reprocessed_psm_vars; reprocessed_cvm_vars: analogously to the
    %       first two, theses are variables created during the reprocessing
    %       of BEHR data with in situ measured profiles.
    %
    %       flag_vars: this are variables that should be added using a
    %       bitwise OR operation rather than the usual weighted average.
    %       This assumes flag variables are usually a bit array, where each
    %       bit that makes up a value in binary has some meaning.
    %
    %       publish_only_gridded_vars: variables that do not get passed to
    %       the omi gridding package, but are still present in the gridded
    %       data and should be included in any published files. Usually
    %       these define the grid (i.e. latitude/longitude).
    %
    %   Methods:
    %       all_gridded_vars(): returns a cell array with all the gridded
    %       variables included.
    %
    %       all_psm_vars(): returns a cell array with all the fields that
    %       can be gridded by PSM (so the standard + reprocessed PSM
    %       fields).
    %
    %       psm_weight_vars(): returns a cell array with the weight field
    %       names corresponding to all of the PSM fields. The gridding
    %       interface allows for each PSM gridded field to have different
    %       weights, so individual weight fields are necessary.
    %
    %       make_wts_field(): given a field name, returns the corresponding
    %       weights field name, assuming it is a PSM variable.
